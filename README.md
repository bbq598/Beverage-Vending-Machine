# Xiaoqing Ding Assignment 6 

This assignment is to simulator a fully automatic beverage vending machine, to implement a controller of this machine. 
 I am using state pattern to doing this implemention, so the basic state is ready to order state, after the class init it will change to this state, then if a customer choose he want tea or coffee, it will change to make tea/coffee state depends on customers choice.  then it will come back to ready to order state after make a drink. I refactore the add condiments part too, now people can choose what caniments they want and there is a limit of 3 caniments per coffee, I am using decorator pattern to make this refactor.After refactore, the project now is more logic and easier to understand. 




# Project Template

This is a Java Maven Project Template


# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn -q clean compile exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.bu.met.cs665.Main" -Dlog4j.configuration="file:log4j.properties"
```

We recommand the above command for running the project. 

Alternativly, you can run the following command. It will generate a single jar file with all of the dependencies. 

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -classpath ./target/JavaProjectTemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```


# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test

```

# Using Findbugs 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn findbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn findbugs:findbugs
```


For more info about FindBugs see 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/
